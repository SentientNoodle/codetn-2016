An introduction to Scholarly Fisticuffs!
Scholarly Fisticuffs is an online, game-based classroom enviroment. The goal of Scholarly Fisticuffs is to make
classroom activities usually considered dull interesting by adding incentives related to an online PvP system in 
the website. Scholarly Fisticuffs uses HTML and Bootstrap for the front-end system that the user sees, and uses
PHP and SQL for its back-end systems. The website primarily consists of moving data such as usernames, inventory,
and class materials between all users on the site and the database. This way, by identifying each user as a teacher
or a student, everyone on the website can see data from other users with a simple refresh. This powers the daily question,
news, PvP, Inventory, and Market systems of the website.
